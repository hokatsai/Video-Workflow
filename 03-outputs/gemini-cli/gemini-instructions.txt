# Using Gemini CLI for Large Codebase Analysis


When analyzing large codebases or multiple files that might exceed context limits, use the Gemini CLI with its massive

context window. Use `gemini` to leverage Google Gemini's large context capacity.


## File and Directory Inclusion Syntax


Use the `@` syntax to include files and directories in your Gemini prompts. The paths should be relative to WHERE you run the

  gemini command:


### Examples:


Single file analysis:

gemini "@src/main.py Explain this file's purpose and structure"


Multiple files:

gemini "@package.json @src/index.js Analyze the dependencies used in the code"


Entire directory:

gemini "@src/ Summarize the architecture of this codebase"


Multiple directories:

gemini "@src/ @tests/ Analyze test coverage for the source code"


Current directory and subdirectories:

gemini "@./ Give me an overview of this entire project"


# Or use --all_files flag:

gemini --all_files  "Analyze the project structure and dependencies"


Implementation Verification Examples


Check if a feature is implemented:

gemini "@src/ @lib/ Has dark mode been implemented in this codebase? Show me the relevant files and functions"


Verify authentication implementation:

gemini "@src/ @middleware/ Is JWT authentication implemented? List all auth-related endpoints and middleware"


Check for specific patterns:

gemini "@src/ Are there any React hooks that handle WebSocket connections? List them with file paths"


Verify error handling:

gemini "@src/ @api/ Is proper error handling implemented for all API endpoints? Show examples of try-catch blocks"


Check for rate limiting:

gemini "@backend/ @middleware/ Is rate limiting implemented for the API? Show the implementation details"


Verify caching strategy:

gemini "@src/ @lib/ @services/ Is Redis caching implemented? List all cache-related functions and their usage"


Check for specific security measures:

gemini "@src/ @api/ Are SQL injection protections implemented? Show how user inputs are sanitized"


Verify test coverage for features:

gemini "@src/payment/ @tests/ Is the payment processing module fully tested? List all test cases"


When to Use Gemini CLI


Use gemini when:

- Analyzing entire codebases or large directories

- Comparing multiple large files

- Need to understand project-wide patterns or architecture

- Current context window is insufficient for the task

- Working with files totaling more than 100KB

- Verifying if specific features, patterns, or security measures are implemented

- Checking for the presence of certain coding patterns across the entire codebase


Important Notes


- Paths in @ syntax are relative to your current working directory when invoking gemini

- The CLI will include file contents directly in the context

- No need for --yolo flag for read-only analysis

- Gemini's context window can handle entire codebases that would overflow Claude's context

- When checking implementations, be specific about what you're looking for to get accurate results
