# State

- **Phase**: Bootstrap (2025-11)
- **Summary**: Removed provisional yt-dlp workflow per user request; repo returns to base scaffold and awaits next tooling decision.
- **Next Steps**:
  1. Define alternative media-download approach only if needed, following Build Mode approval.
  2. Keep `PLAYBOOKS.md` focused on conversational intents until new tools exist.
  3. Prioritize documenting future tooling gaps in SYSTEM_MEMORY before implementation.
